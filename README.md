# APICO-Landscaping
Let there be land(scaping)!

This idea is still evolving but seeing as we can place decorations on top of tiles, I had an idea that we could place flat "decorations" on tiles as a means for building paths. 

**Specifications:**

This mod will introduce a new landscaping tool, a landscaping menu sprite, and sprites for path decorations.

Tool functions:
- Right-clicking on the tool will open a menu sprite with a 3x3 grid displaying path patterns.
- Selecting a slot from the opened menu by left-clicking will apply the selected pattern to the landscaping tool. 
- Left-clicking with the tool on grass tiles after a pattern has been applied to the tool will place the "decoration" down.
- Left-clicking with the tool on grass tiles where a pattern decoration has already been placed down will replace the existing decoration with the current one applied to the landscaping tool.

Menu sprite:
- Menu will have a title at the top, like other standard menus in the game. 
- Menu will have a 3x3 grid of a cohesive pattern (think "the path" folks use in ACNH).
- The default selected pattern will be the first slot on the menu (top left slot on the grid).
- The selected slot (selected pattern) will be visualized with a highlighted border. 

Path decorations:
- Paths will be provided as a 3x3 grid with each section being 16x16.
- Path decorations that have been placed down will be interactable with a hammer. 
- Hammered path decorations will disappear into the void.
